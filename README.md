# Supervised-Regression
Using Deep Learning techniques, predict the coordinates (x,y) of a pixel which has a value of 255 for 1 pixel in a given 50x50 pixel grayscale image and all other pixels are 0. The pixel with a value of 255 is randomly assigned. You may generate a dataset as required for solving the problem.
